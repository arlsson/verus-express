## Next Install Batch

Run these to add the next highest-value missing primitives:

```bash

yarn dlx shadcn-svelte@latest add breadcrumb command table pagination popover progress toggle toggle-group
```

## First Refactor Slice

- `src/routes/+layout.svelte`: add global `Toaster` provider.
- `src/lib/components/wallet/sections/Receive.svelte`: migrate copy feedback to toast and replace raw field markup with UI primitives.
- `src/lib/components/ui/label/*`: add `Label` primitive for consistent form labeling.
